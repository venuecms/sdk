## The Venue CMS TypeScript SDK
@venuecms/sdk

This package is the core of the Venue CMS TypeScript SDK.

To get started, you can install the SDK by running:
```bash
npm install @venuecms/sdk
```

Examples are strewn throughout the SDK reference which you can browse in the table of contents on the left.

If you are interested in Next.js make sure to use the `@venuecms/sdk-next` to take advantage of some extra optimizations and React components. The core SDK is included in that package as well so the reference will still apply.

For an example of a fully-built minimal application using this SDK, check out our template which we use in production and update frequently [here](https://github.com/venuecms/template-minimal).
