# Overview

Welcome to the Venue Developer Documentation.

You can find references for the Venue SDK's here on the left-side table of contents.

* [@venuecms/sdk](sdk/) - Our TypeScript general SDK (using fetch)
* [@venuecms/sdk-next](sdk-next/) - Our Next.js specific SDK leveraging some extra optimizations of Next.js and includes the Venue React components.
* [API](rest-api/api/v2/public/) - If you prefer to use the REST API directly, see our OpenAPI specification and documentation here.

For an example of a fully-built minimal application using an SDK, check out our template which we use in production and update frequently [here](https://github.com/venuecms/template-minimal).
