# Next.js SDK

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/%40venuecms%2Fsdk--next-v0-passing?style=flat&logo=npm&link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.npmjs.com%2Fpackage%2F%40venuecms%2Fsdk-next)

This library contains a small collection of components that are useful for rendering content from Venue CMS in a Next.js project. It also includes the Venue CMS SDK as well so there is no need to separately install that.

To install run this in your CLI under the project root:

```bash
npm install @venuecms/sdk-next
```

For more information on fetching data see the reference for @venuecms/sdk
